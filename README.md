This repository contains the source code and training scripts for the models presented in our research paper titled **"Multi-domain CSI-based Indoor Localization with Deep Attention Networks (DAN) for MIMO JCAS system"**.

We propose a deep learning-based approach to indoor localization using Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple domains ‚Äî **Complex** and **Polar** representations across different subcarrier groups (domains). Our final model utilizes a deep attention-based architecture (DAN) to effectively fuse and learn from multi-domain CSI data.
